There are two classes one Main other one Student class.

In the Main class.

While calling the setter methods use studentName ( in line 6 ) and studentAge ( in line 8 )

Example:

Age = 12

Student name is Steven.
Steven is 12 years old.

Note: while printing use a  toString method in the Student Class.
