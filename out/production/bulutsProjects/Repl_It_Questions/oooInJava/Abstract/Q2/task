6 classes created Calculator, Sum, Divide, Multiply , Substract , Main

Make Calculator is a super class.

in the super class
    create a abstract method name is calculating
           there are two int parameters
            return type is int


in the Sum class
       extends the Calculator class
         override the calculating method in the super class
            sum two parameters and return the result

in the Divide class
       extends the Calculator class
         override the calculating method in the super class
            divide two parameters and return the result

in the Multiply class
       extends the Calculator class
         override the calculating method in the super class
            multiply two parameters and return the result

in the Substract class
       extends the Calculator class
         override the calculating method in the super class
            substract two parameters and return the result

in the main class
   create Scanner object
   create two int and assign scanner to these two int variables

call the calculating method in the Sum class
print the result
call the calculating method in the Divide class
print the result
call the calculating method in the Multiply class
print the result
call the calculating method in the Substract class
print the result
