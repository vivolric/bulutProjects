Java 8 introduces the “Default Method” or (Defender methods) feature, which allows the developer to add new methods to
the interfaces without breaking their existing implementation. It provides the flexibility to allow interface to define
implementation which will use as the default in a situation where a concrete class fails to provide an implementation
for that method.

    @ The abstract class can define constructors.                       @ It doses not allow to define constructors.
    @ It does not allow Multiple Inheritance.                           @ It allows Multiple Inheritance.
    @ It allows create method with body.                                @ It does not allow to create method with body.

When we extend an interface that contains a default method, we can perform following,

@ Not override the default method and will inherit the default method.
@ Override the default method similar to other methods we override in subclass..
@ Redeclare default method as abstract, which force subclass to override it.
