QUESTION

  1) Why did you use constructor instead of encapsulation in the Employee class
       If you use encapsulation why did you use encapsulation instead of constructor?

  2) Why did you made the employee variables as protected ?
            What could happen if the variables are private ?
            What could happen if the variables are public ?

                 Note: Answer is NOT because I type it in this way.

  Type these answer in the below of the code , command part.

Given main class

   Create an object for the manager and worker classes

   First print manager object.
   Second print worker object.

Given class Employee. (parent class)

 Create 3 protected variables.
 String name
 int salary
 String department

Set the name , department and salary  (Note: you can use constructor or encapsulation )

Salary should be between 50000 to 120000

if it is out of these range then throw an error which is "Salary should be between 50000 to 120000"

Given class Manager (Child class)

Create one private
int underemployed

add underemployed to manager constructor.
instance variable underemployed equal to constructor parameter.

Create a toString method which is printing all the instance variables

For example;
Name is Emily
Salary is 60000
department is Seller
underemployed is 5

Your result should be
Name = Emily
Salary = 60000
Department = Seller
Underemployed = 5

Given class Worker (Child class)

Create a instance variable private
int hourlyIncome

add hourlyIncome to Constructor
multiply hourlyIncome with 2080 (Calculating the yearly income)
yearly income should be between 50000 to 120000

Create a toString method which is printing all the instance variables

For example:
Name is Steven
department is IT
hourlyIncome is 45

Your result should be
Name = Emily
Department = IT
Hourly income = 93600
