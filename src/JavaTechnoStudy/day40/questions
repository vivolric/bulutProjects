1) What is JDK, JRE and JVM?

  jvm -> java virtual machine: run time environment for compiled java class fields
  jre -> java runtime environment: jvm + library classes, it is  used to run your java application
  jdk -> java development kit: jre + development tools

  JDK – Java Development Kit is Kit which provides the environment to develop
  execute the Java program  which includes two things
  Development Tools and JRE .
  JRE – Java Runtime Environment
  JVM – Java Virtual machine
  JVM checks everything, converts JAVA codes to the bytecode

2)Explain  "public static void main(String args[])" in Java ?

  It is entry point, we can not run the code without main method.

3) Explain  "public static void main(String args[])" in Java ?
and  can we have multiple main methods?
 Yes but, it is not the main method, where you run the code...
 it is only the method with similar name (public static void main)

4) Why Java is platform independent?
  Because the Java compiler converts the source code to bytecode
  Bytecode can be executed on any platform (OS) using JVM(Java Virtual Machine)

5) What are wrapper classes in Java?
   Class whose object wraps or contains a primitive data types.
    Example: chocolate - is primitive type, Wrapper class - chocolate in the wrapper for sale

6) Why do we need wrapper classes?
   To use them in the List, in the Maps..

7) What are constructors in Java?
 Constructors are the methods to create object of the class and names are the same with class

8) Can we have multiple constructors in the class?, how?
   Yes we can have multiple constructors using Overloading, changing Parameters

9) What is the difference between Constructor vs Method?
   Constructor is a function which is the member of a class.
   Methods consists of statements that may or may not return an output.

   Constructor is a special type of method that has the same name the class name.
   These methods are used to initialize an object's state.

10)Can we reuse constructors? if yes, how?
   Yes, with "this"..

11) What is the difference between break and continue statements?
    What if you have nested loop, what then?
    Break and continue statements are being used in the loops;
    break is used stop the loop, continue is used to skip that part in the loop

12) Differentiate between static and non-static methods in Java.

    Static methods can called by name of the class
    Non static is called by instance(object) of the class.

    static - belongs to class,
    non-static - belongs to object. example:Car.getWheels();     Car car = new Car();
                                                                 car.getWheels();

13) Can we call static method using instance variable?
    Yes,  Example - Math.random VS random.next(Int)

14) What type of the collections do you use?
    Map is in the "Java Collection Framework" such as Set, List, Map, SortedSet, SortedMap,
    HashSet, TreeSet, ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector, Collections, Arrays, AbsractCollection


15) What is the difference between LinkedHashSet and TreeSet?
    LinkedHashSet - is holding the elements as they were entered, insertion order
    TreeSet - from minimum to maximum, alphabetical and numerical order  Person{name, age}
                                                                                                    ArrayList<Person>
                                                                                                    sort by age of Person
16) What is the difference between a local variable and an instance variable?
    local variable can be used in the method (inside of curly braces)
    instance variable can be used in class (public String name)

18) What is "final" keyword in Java?
    Using the final keyword means that the value can't be modified in the future

19) What purpose do the keywords final, finally in Java?
    final is for class, method, or variable so they can't be changed.
    finally is used in try catch so  the finally code will be executed whether the exception is handled or not

    finally is used in Try and Catch block - it executes code no matter if Exception is catched or not
    Final - is non access modifier

20) What are the different ways to handle exceptions?

    throw, try and catch

21)What is the difference between throw and throws?

   throws shows us that method has an exception which is need to be handled
   throw creating an exception


22) What is the difference between an array and an array list?

    Array  holds values of primitive data type and length should be defined when initializing.
    Arraylist holds values of Reference data type, no need to define the size, it is expandable.
    ArrayList is dynamic
    Arraylist is easy to print array need extra method

23) Which members of class can have access modifiers?

    variable, methods, constructors

24)What is the difference between equals() and == in Java?

    equals is when you're comparing String.. == is when your comparing int, double, float

25)What are the concepts of OOP in Java?

    A PIE: Abstract, polymorphysm, inheritance and encapsulation

26) Difference between String, StringBuilder, and StringBuffer?
    String is immutable data type,
    StringBuilder and StringBuffer are mutable data type
    StringBuilder is fastest dataType
