Definition and Usage
The extends keyword extends a class
(indicates that a class is inherited from another class).

In Java, it is possible to inherit attributes and methods from one class to another.
We group the "inheritance concept" into two categories:

subclass (child) - the class that inherits from another class
superclass (parent) - the class being inherited from
To inherit from a class, use the extends keyword.
