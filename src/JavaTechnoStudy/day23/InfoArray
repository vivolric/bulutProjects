Differences between Array and ArrayList

       Array                                vs                     ArrayList
- Array is fixed  size                                     - Dynamic size (resizable)
- contains primitive and object                            - Contain only objects
- Array is part of core Java programming                   - Part of collection framework
- We use length method in Array ( arr.length  )            - We use size method in ArrayList ( size().arrL )


Differences between Set and ArrayList

       Set                         vs                   ArrayList
- No duplication                                 - It allows duplication



// hashSet: it is not ordered and there is no duplication
// LinkedHashSet: ordered version of HashSet, insertion order
// treeSet: Ascending Order, Alphabetical, Numerical Order
